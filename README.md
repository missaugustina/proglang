proglang
========

This is a place for me to keep track of what I've done for the Programming Languages Coursera class.
The class is available at: https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang

If the class is not currently active, you can still work through the material. Visit #coursera-pl on irc.freenode.net and I've got the lecture notes and homework assignments in this repo.

The PDFs for the homework assignments and provided code are located in the "homework" directory.
PDFs the lecture slides are in notes.

The "code" directory are the example code from the lectures.

You can watch the lectures on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/afigfigueira/playlists?shelf_id=6&sort=dd&view=50

I am also using this repo to store my solutions for homework assignments in the subdirectory "completed_assignments". If you are another student taking the class, you should not be taking my answers and using them as your own.
